About Socrata

Our mission at Socrata is to unleash the power of data to improve the world around us. Since 2007, we have focused exclusively on democratizing access to the vast troves of data held by government institutions around the world and making that data useful to people in their daily lives.
As a start-up, we have set out to develop a new kind of software infrastructure and an open innovation network designed to unlock the flow of data into the economy and put it in people’s hands. We’re part of a global movement called “Open Data” where a growing community of civic innovators, elected leaders, software developers, entrepreneurs, journalists, and researchers are applying new, data-driven solutions to age-old problems in government and society as a whole. 
Socrata customers are using their data to improve quality of life in the communities they serve, in a variety of ways, including creating safer neighborhoods, better schools, more accessible and affordable healthcare, a more responsive and accountable government, and more efficient transportation solutions.
Our software platform and cloud-based solutions support the world’s most ambitious open data innovation programs at every level of government around the world. We’re proud to support the missions of the US Federal Government; a third of US states, most major US cities like NYC, Chicago, LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, Boston, New Orleans, and Baltimore; numerous counties; as well as government institutions in Kenya, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Mexico, Brazil, and Canada; in addition to some of the most recognizable and prestigious NGOs, including the World Bank, the United Nations, and the Gates Foundation.
Socrata has 85 employees and is headquartered in a vibrant and creative workspace in the Pioneer Square neighborhood in Seattle, WA. The company also has regional offices in London, England and less than a mile from the White House in Washington, DC. Socrata has raised $25M in venture backing to date, from OpenView Venture Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Frazier Technology Ventures. You can learn more about Socrata at www.socrata.com.
